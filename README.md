# My Configuration

This is a guide to setting up my environment. Having to start from scratch multiple times, I think it is about time I put some of the steps into writing. If you are reading this and following along, please note these are just my preferences and you will likely have your own opinions. Feel free to tweak these settings or send me suggestions.
